# Enhanced Plan for MLOps Pipeline

## 1. Webscraper - Data Collection
- Implement multiprocessing for efficient data scraping.
- Automate the scraping process with scheduling (consider using tools like cron or Airflow).
- Consolidate scraped data and implement a mechanism to account for and handle duplicates.
- Add robust error handling and logging to record any issues during the scraping process.
- Ensure that the scraping respects the terms of service of the websites.

## 2. Data PreProcessing
- Clean and format data: handle missing values, outliers, and format data as required.
- Merge new data with existing data ensuring consistency.
- Automate preprocessing steps with functions or pipelines.
- Automate Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand data distributions, correlations, etc.
- Implement data versioning (consider tools like DVC) to keep track of data changes over time.

## 3. Model Training
- Use the Random Forest Regressor algorithm for training based on prior testing.
- Implement RandomizedSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning.
- Save performance scores for each model version for comparison and tracking.
- Visualize model performance metrics and save these graphs for future reference.
- Train the final model on the best hyperparameters found during tuning.
- Save model checkpoints during training for potential use in future.
- Automate the training process to trigger on updates to the dataset version.

## 4. Model Deployment - TO DO
- Set up a staging environment for testing the model before deployment.
- Convert the stock database into the same format as the trained data.
- Apply the model to a new column in the stock database.
- Score the model's predictions and potentially involve human evaluation for accuracy.

## 5. Evaluate Model Performance in the Wild - TO DO
- Regularly evaluate the model's performance scores in the production environment.
- Track model outputs against historical real-world data (e.g., scraped data).
- Monitor for data drift - changes in the input data over time.
- Based on performance and data drift, determine whether to update the model or roll back to a previous version.

## 6. Continuous Integration and Deployment
- Set up a CI/CD pipeline for automating the training, testing, and deployment of your models.
- Log all key metrics and events, and set up a monitoring system to track these logs.
- Set up automated alerts for significant changes in model performance or data drift.
